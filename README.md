# SavableSFSample

 A sample system for ScenarioFlow with more advanced functions than [SimpleSFSample](https://github.com/dotprologue/SimpleSFSample.git). It includes functions for saving scenario data, for example, you can load any scene that has been saved or you can jump to any scene that has been done already.

 To run example:

+ Open `SavableSFSample/SampleScene`
+ Make sure that the `StorySelectionCanvas/StorySelectionPanel/ScenarioSelectionButtonParent` object in the Hierarchy window has two objects, and the two scripts `Quiz` and `Quiz_Alt` are respectively attached to the `ScenarioScript` property of those objects
+ Enter the play mode

### CAUTION

+ This sample will cause conflict with SimpleSFSample. If you have already imported SimpleSFSample, you have to delete it before importing this sample or create a new Unity project.
+ All the scripts in SavableSFSample are published under the MIT license, so you can use them freely as long as you follow the license. However, the use of the images used in the sample, for example, images of Sheena, Rio, and other UIs, is permitted only for private use intended for learning purposes or citation.
